/*
 *  Title: Test for HTML comments (i.e. <!-- -->).
 *
 *  Example 1: Because an HTML comment like
 *  <!-- This is a simple example for how the API is used. -->
 *  is only visible to article authors, it should rather either be made visible to readers,
 *  e.g. by replacing it by
 *  <p>This is a simple example for how the API is used.</p>
 *  or just be removed.
 *
 *  Implementation notes: This test searches for all HTML comments. Because CKEditor escapes them
 *  for security reasons, they need to be decoded first before displaying them.
